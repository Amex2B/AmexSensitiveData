"Dear Miss Asia Wyman,

Thank you for reaching out with interest in our animal-assisted therapy programs. We are excited for the opportunity to share more about the unique benefits these therapies can provide. My name is Cristal and I am the International Security Administrator for our Response team at O'Kon LLC.

Animal-assisted therapy involves interaction with animals to help humans with their physical and mental health. Our therapy animals, often dogs, are trained to provide affection, comfort, and love to people. We deliver these services in various settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and even virtually due to the 24th January pandemic.

People of all ages and with a variety of conditions can benefit from animal-assisted therapy. It can help reduce feelings of anxiety, depression, and isolation. It also contributes to improving social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Patients with conditions such as autism, dementia, and post-traumatic stress disorder have noticed positive changes after participating in our programs. Please note that we have precautions in place to ensure the safety and well-being of our patients and animals.

You expressed interest in our programs for 15 seniors in particular. We have seen great results with our senior programs, notably an improvement in mood and an increased desire for social interaction. If you could confirm the Fort Audrastead location where these services will be needed, I can help set up the initial sessions.

To get started, I will need you to fill out some documentation so we can better understand the patient's needs. The paperwork can be accessed via the https://private-logo.org, using Gabrielle_Barrows59 and the password - mSVITX0sWCoS. If you have any specific queries or need assistance filling out the forms, please don't hesitate to email me at Jeanie72@gmail.com or call on (736).4444373. 

In terms of payment, we accept the Egyptian Pound through Personal Loan Account with account number 58223475. The cost for each therapy session is ₫141810.74. kindly verify the amount before making the payment.

Thank you once again for your interest in our animal-assisted therapy programs. We look forward to using the unique bond between humans and animals to bring positive change into your lives.
